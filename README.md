# Java: Golf-Club-Secretary

A simple Java project, to represent the secretarial side of a Golf Club establishment.

Features:

- Name your Golf Club.

- Create lists of amateur and professional members.

- Personal details for each member.

- Supports recording of details concerning membership and handicap.

- Supports CONGU handicap adjustment.

- Also supports Junior members, Artisan members, and for when an amateur turns professional.

I originally created this as a practice for keeping my Java skills sharp throughout university.

I hope someone can find use for this project.
